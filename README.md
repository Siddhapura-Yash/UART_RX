# UART Receiver (RX) – Verilog

This project implements a **simple UART Receiver (RX)** in **Verilog**.  
It receives **serial data**, converts it into **8-bit parallel data**, and raises a **done** signal when one byte is successfully received.

The design is **parameterized** for clock frequency and baud rate, and includes a **testbench** for simulation and verification.
